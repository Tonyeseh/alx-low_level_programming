# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while.
##### Concepts learnt are variables, `if`, `else`, `else if`, integral types, operators(arithmetic, logical and relational), `while` loop, keywords.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
	* [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c) - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. It prints whether the number stored in `n` is positive or negative.

* **1. The last digit**
	* []() - This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. The last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.
	* The output of the program is the string `Last digit of` followed by `n` followed by the string `is` followed by:
		* if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the `string and is greater than 5`
		* if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `and is 0`
		* if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`

* **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
	* [2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c) - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line using `putchar` and calling it twice.

* **3. alphABET**
	* [3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c) - prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line using `putchar` just 3 times.

* **4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
	* [4-print_alphabt.c](./4-print_alphabt.c) - prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line except `q` and `e` using `putchar` twice.

* **5. Numbers**
	* [5-print_numbers.c](./5-print_numbers.c) - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

* **6. Numberz**
	* [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c) - prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line without using any variable of type `char` and using `putchar` twice.
