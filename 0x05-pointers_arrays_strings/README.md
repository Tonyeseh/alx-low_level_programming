# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
Concepts learnt were `Pointers` and arrays and `Data structure`. `Memory layout of programs`, `Strings`, `Pointers` and `Arrays` were learnt in this project.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
* **0. 98 Battery st.**
 * [0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c) - takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.

* **1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**
 * [1-swap.c](./1-swap.c) - swaps the values of two integers.

* **2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**
 * [2-strlen.c](./2-strlen.c) - returns the length of a string. Similar to `strlen`.

* **3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**
 * [3-puts.c](./3-puts.c) - prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`. Similar to `puts`

* **4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**
 * [4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c) - prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

* **5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes**
 * [5-rev_string.c](./5-rev_string.c) - reverses a string.

* **6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true**
 * [6-puts2.c](./6-puts2.c) - prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

* **7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half**
 * [7-puts_half.c](./7-puts_half.c) - prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

* **8. Arrays are not pointers**
 * [8-print_array.c](./8-print_array.c) - prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

* **9. strcpy**
 * [9-strcpy.c](./9-strcpy.c) -  copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`. Similar to `strcpy`.

* **10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers**
 * [100-atoi.c](./100-atoi.c) - convert a string to an integer.

* **11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code**
 * [101-keygen.c](./101-keygen.c) -  generates random valid passwords for the program [101-crackme](./101-crackme).
