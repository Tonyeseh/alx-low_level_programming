* **0. Preprocessor**
	* [0-preprocessor](./0-preprocessor): runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file. th c file name is saved in a variable $CFILE and output is said in file c.

* **1. Compiler**
	* [1-compiler](./1-compiler): compiles a C file but does not link. Note: The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE and The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c

* **2. Assembler**
	* [2-assembler](./2-assembler): generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. Note: The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE and The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c

* **3. Name**
	* [3-name](./3-name): compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun. Note: The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE

* **4. Hello, puts**
	* [4-puts.c](./4-puts.c): prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line. Note: Using the function puts and returns 0.

* ****
	* [5-printf.c](./5-printf.c): prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line. using the function printf and returns 0.

* ****
	* [6-size.c](./6-size.c): prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux to test the -m32 gcc option. program return 0.

* ****
	* [100-intel](./100-intel): generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file. Note: The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.The output file will be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.

* ****
	* [101-quote.c](./101-quote.c): prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error. returns 1.
