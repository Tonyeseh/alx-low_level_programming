# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
Learnt about `nested while loops`, `functions`, `function protoypes`, `header files`...

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
* **0. isupper**
	* [0-isupper.c](./0-isupper.c) - function that checks for uppercase character. Similar to `isupper`.

* **1. isdigit**
	* [1-isdigit.c](./1-isdigit.c) - Checks for a digit (`0` through `9`). Similar to `isdigit`.

* **2. Collaboration is multiplication**
	* [2-mul.c](./2-mul.c) - multiplies two integers.

* **3. The numbers speak for themselves**
	* [3-print_numbers.c](./3-print_numbers.c) - prints the numbers, `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.

* **4. I believe in numbers and signs**
	* [4-print_most_numbers.c](./4-print_most_numbers.c) - prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line except `2` and `4`.

* **5. Numbers constitute the only universal language**
	* [5-more_numbers.c](./5-more_numbers.c) - prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line.

* **6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line**
	* [6-print_line.c](./6-print_line.c) -6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line

* **7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe**
	* [7-print_diagonal.c](./7-print_diagonal.c) -draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

* **8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch**
	* [8-print_square.c](./8-print_square.c) - prints a square, followed by a new line.

* **9. Fizz-Buzz**
	* [9-fizz_buzz.c](./9-fizz_buzz.c) - prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

* **10. Triangles**
	* [10-print_triangle.c](./10-print_triangle.c) - prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

* **11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic**
	* [100-prime_factor.c](./100-prime_factor.c) - finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.

* **12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper**
	* [101-print_number.c](./101-print_number.c) - prints an integer using only `_putchar`.
